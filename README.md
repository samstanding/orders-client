This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is the client side application for my Order Tracker. You can find the Rails API and instructions for setting that up [here](https://github.com/samstanding/orders-api). 


To get this up and running run `yarn install` or `npm install` to download all dependencies. Then run `yarn start` or `npm start` to get the development server up and running.
